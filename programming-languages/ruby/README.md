# Ruby Project

I'll be honest. I don't have too much of a clue of what I did about these Ruby exercises (they were created 4 years ago). Each `*.rb` file is a problem solved with the Ruby language, following the problem statements in `spec.pdf`.

I'll give a new look at these problems some time in 202X :D
