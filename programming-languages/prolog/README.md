# Prolog Project

I'll be honest. I don't a single clue of what I did about these Prolog exercises (they were created 4 years ago). Each `*.pro` file is a problem solved with the Prolog language, following the problem statements in `spec.pdf`.

I'll give a new look at these problems some time in 202X :D
