# Project 4

A Binary Tree structure and operations implementation. The program must read a sequence of instructions (in the given file) and produces and manages a Tree that will write back its current status and results of operations.

Run it with `docker-compose build && docker-compose run program`. See input file at `case.in` and output file at `case.out`.

As a side program, there is a `CaseMaker.py` file that can generate new test cases.
