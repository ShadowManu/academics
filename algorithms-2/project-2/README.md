# Project 2

A CPU-tasks scheduler implementation. The program receives a list of program specifications (duration, memory, etc) and will simulate a discrete (by-second) execution of the programs in a 4-core 1GB-memory computer.

Run it with `docker-compose build && docker-compose run program`. See input programs at `case.in` and output file at `case.out`.
